## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Key pending decisions for v1.1:

- [Pending]: Datum offset as additive translation constant `datum_offset_in` — not a geometry change
- [Pending]: D-box composite model replaces cap-only I-beam in `fea_adapter.py`
- [Pending]: Surrogate fallback for CI when OpenVSP not installed

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: OpenVSP Python bindings install on MacBook not yet verified — may need Homebrew formula or source build
- Phase 4: Validation tolerances (2" / 3% for NP) are estimates — may need adjustment after seeing real VSPAERO vs surrogate discrepancy
- Phase 6: `physics_baseline.json` is self-referential — do not extend it; Phase 6 replaces it

### Carry-Forward from v1.0

- CadQuery/OCP must be mocked in tests: `sys.modules.setdefault("cadquery", MagicMock())`
- Lazy imports in `core/__init__.py` via `__getattr__` + `_LAZY_IMPORTS` dict
- `apply_washout(0.0)` reconstructs Airfoil from split coords — use relaxed tolerances
- `analyze_distributed` API takes `total_load_lbf` (not `load_per_inch`)
- AR discrepancy (published 7.3 vs computed 6.34) is reference area convention, not bug
